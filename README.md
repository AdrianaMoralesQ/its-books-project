For my final project in the Bootcamp, I decided to build a social media website for people in book clubs. The app requires users to log in via Auth0, and from there they can create and join book clubs, rate books they've read and create polls for the next book they will read. 

## Description

It's Books is a social media platform where user can connect with friends and join different book clubs. Users can create their own book clubs, join exisiting ones and vote on books they would like to read in the future, as well as rate books they've read in the past. 


## Objective 🏔️
Building a social media platform that used an authenticator, allowed users to naviagte to different pages and contained modals, forms and polls. The platform had to use MongoDB as a database. 

tldr:
* Used MongoDB as a database
*Full Stack application
* Creating a user-friendly, clean-coded and application


## Stack 💻

### Next.js

### Auth0 API
* Used for authentication

### Mongo DB API: 

* Manages user session
* Stores user information
* Saves user profile and book related information

### Styled Components 💅🏾

* Allows for adding styles with Javascript
* Entire design and implementation was done by me, no styling libraries were allowed

## Executing program 

* Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
